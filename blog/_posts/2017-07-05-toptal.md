I was talking to a long time friend to see if he knew anyone looking for help from a developer / consultant.  He said he had good luck with http://toptal.com .  So next, i search hacker news for a discussion on it, and the response seemed to be mostly positive.  Certainly, no where near as much vitriol as i usually see about freelancing middlemen.  Its also gave me a good excuse to resurrect this blog.  The signup process so far has been pretty smooth.  Looking forward to getting into the software consulting community.
