I am a radiologist at UT MDACC, a cancer hospital in houston.  I am interested in data mining and image segmentation.  I also maintain garglets, a PACS plugin from my colleagues to enhance our radiology user interface.  Garglets were mostly written in [AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com).  These days they include some python code running on a small windows cluster.
